;; idea
;; this is like the rooms and keys problem
;; we dfs on each room
;; in doing so, we create a data structure of a province
;; at the end, we could how many provinces there are

;; each node is a node's connection to others
;; ex: (0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0) means we have 8 nodes, and this node is either 4 or 5 and connected to whichever node it isn't

;; idea
;; make an enumeration of each node
;; go to node 1
;; dfs
;; for each 1 in node 1, add it to a list
;;    for each node in the list recurse and add new items to that list
;;      if that node hasn't been seen before
;; for the first node that isn't in the first dfs repeat the process
;; when the other list is empty, count up the unique sets

;; we are trying to make n coverings
;; try just on node 1
